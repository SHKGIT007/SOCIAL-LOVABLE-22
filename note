  4)Please allow our customers to access the tool. They should be able to login only once invited. User ID and Password login will be required to allow them to login. Ability to send link from the system so that customers can view the reports and upload the paperwork without any login. However this should be restricted to only those users to whom email has been sent to. They should be able to access only their own company, clients and jobs. This can be chosen at the time of sending the invitation. They should be allowed to upload the paperwork, see the reports on their jobs only. Please ask me as many questions as possible so that I can provide all the detail that you need. New Role type should be created for all the customers and this role will be called Customer where we will limit what they can access and what they cant

 5)Notes feature in the timesheet should be against each cell where user should be able to add notes for each hour cell by clicking on a small link next to it.

7)Please allow Users to be allocated to Customer, Clients and Jobs from their Staff section as well. Multiple Allocations should be possible.
